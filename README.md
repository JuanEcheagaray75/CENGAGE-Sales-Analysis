# CENGAGE Sales Analysis: A Data Science Approach



In this repository I will be going over the basic steps of The Team Data Science Process lifecycle proposed by Microsoft click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-science-process/lifecycle) for more info.

> As a disclosure, this repository does not exactly follow every step of the process, but it's loosely based on it's directives. It's the best lifecycle I could find in the beginning stages of the project
